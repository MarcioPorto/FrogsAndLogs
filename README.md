# Frogs And Logs

This is a simple Unity game written in C#, as seen on Treehouse's [How to Make a Video Game](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-video-game). Once I am done with [Paroli](https://github.com/MarcioPorto/Paroli), I intend to come back and make changes to this game. So stay tuned!
